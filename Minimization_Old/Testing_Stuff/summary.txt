What is the difference between decentralized and centralized 
security?
Centralized networks are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and 
data breaches because all the data is stored in one central 
location. This makes it easier for hackers to target and steal 
sensitive information. 
On the other hand, decentralized networks use multiple nodes to 
store data.
Decentralized security moves responsibilities and controls away 
from the center, to the individual areas most vulnerable to 
attack today. Decentralized security enables risk management 
and security enforcement right across the business. It 
empowers every team, and makes security everyone's 
responsibility.




Benefits of decentralization
Provides a trustless environment
In a decentralized blockchain network, no one has to know or trust anyone else. Each
member in the network has a copy of the exact same data in the form of a distributed
ledger. If a member’s ledger is altered or corrupted in any way, it will be rejected by the
majority of the members in the network.
Improves data reconciliation
Companies often exchange data with their partners. This data, in turn, is typically
transformed and stored in each party’s data silos, only to resurface when it needs to be
passed downstream. Each time the data is transformed, it opens up opportunities for data
loss or incorrect data to enter the workstream. By having a decentralized data store,
every entity has access to a real-time, shared view of the data.
Reduces points of weakness
Decentralization can reduce points of weakness in systems where there may be too much
reliance on specific actors. These weak points could lead to systemic failures, including
failure to provide promised services or inefficient service due to the exhaustion of
resources, periodic outages, bottlenecks, lack of sufficient incentives for good service, or
corruption.
Optimizes resource distribution
Decentralization can also help optimize the distribution of resources so that promised
services are provided with better performance and consistency, as well as a reduced
likelihood of catastrophic failure.







Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, 
servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and 
data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information 
technology security or electronic information security.

INTRODUCTION

¢ As the world goes online and people relays on the
Internet for their routine processes and habits, it is
essential to maintain the security of online data.
Blockchain, a notable buzzword of recent days has
taken charges to secure online data.

Once blockchain technology has been introduced,
the focus is on the fulfilment of the information
security properties it provides. Focusing on data
integrity, blockchain ledger is immutable.

APPLICATION OF BLOCKCHAIN IN CYBER
SECURITY

1. A Decentralized Storage Medium :

As we people move faster with online, it is very necessary to make a safer

environment for all the personal information that we share on a medium

(computer or internet ). Most of the business still use a centralized medium
for its data storage, which makes it easier for hackers to reach data for stealing.

Since Blockchain-based decentralized storage medium can prevent business
data theft and hacks.

2. Security in DNS:

Most of the DNS is centralized and hackers can break the connections between
a domain name and IP address and can also make the website unavailable.
Hackers in recent days try to pair DNS attacks with DDoS attacks to render
websites unusable for a certain period of time.

Using blockchain technology can make it difficult for hackers as your data or
information are stored immutable on a decentralized, distributed ledger and
immutable smart contracts are present to power connections.

3. Securing Edge Devices via Identity Authentication:

obvious

Edge devices present especially vulnerable access points into core networks.
One example is an employee who logs into their company’s servers via their
own unsecured phone. For a hacker, penetrating an entire network through a
blatant vulnerability via an edge device is like taking candy from a baby.
Ensuring that these devices, as well as the core network itself, are insulated
with multi-step authentication processes and blockchain-level, decentralized
threat mitigation protocols is the first step in patching some of the most
network entry points that hackers could exploit.

FUTURE OF BLOCKCHAIN-BASED CYBER
SECURITY

¢ Blockchain technology can be utilized to prevent any type of data breaches, identity
thefts, cyber-attacks or false transactions ensuring data privacy and security.

« As days pass, the rate of Cybercriminals is raising which In turns create jobs for
security professionals over the next few years. It is the blockchain technology that
tends to be the saviour of data security.

¢ Cyber Security will be boosted double the amount of cybercriminals rate, only when
blockchain technology has been used as a medium of data storage.

CONCLUSION

¢ Blockchain technology is a
breakthrough in cyber _ security,
as it can ensure the highest level of
data confidentiality, availability,
and security. However, the
complexity of the technology may
cause difficulties with development

and real-world use.
