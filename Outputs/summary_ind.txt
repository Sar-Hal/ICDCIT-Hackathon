ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING(3D PRINTING)
Additive Manufacturing or 3D 
Printing is a computer controlled 
process that creates 3D objects by 
depositing materials, usually in 
layers.
It is the opposite of subtractive 
manufacturing which was used 
earlier involving gradual removal of 
layers from a solid block of any 
material to form a 3D object.
Offers significant benefits to a wide 
range of industries, whether it's for 
agile product customization, or 
rapid and cost-effective spare 
parts procurement.
Complex shapes and design 
elements can be easily cured on 
the materials using additive
manufacturing techniques.
ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING(AM) IN INDUSTRY 4.0
•
Industry 4.0 promotes the integration of smart technologies 
and production systems through AM.
•
AM Technology like 3D printers can rapidly prototype and 
produce high-performance, customized products thus 
reducing build times and creating a more durable product.
•
AM allows developers to incorporate complex designs and 
features without increasing cost.
•
High-performance, decentralized AM systems will reduce 
transport distances and stock on hand.
11

PROCESS INVOLVES IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING(3D PRINTING):
•
Modeling: 3D printing begins with the process of designing the product in digital form using software like 
AutoCAD, solid works, etc.
•
STL File Format (Standard Tessellation Language / Standard Triangle Language): STL file format is mostly 
used in Stereo lithography, used for describing the surface geometry of an object to be printed by the 
3D printer before the process starts.
•
3D Slicing: It is the process of breaking down a design into several layers. A slicer generates a G-code 
which helps in providing instructions to the 3D printer that is how the print process should be carried out.
12

WORKING PRINCIPLE OF ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING(3D PRINTING):
1.
The first step is the generation of 3D geometric modeling of the components to be made in 
AutoCAD, Pro/E, Catia, Solid work, or using any other CAD software.
2.
After the creation of the digital CAD model, the CAD file is converted to the additive 
manufacturing file (AMF) format or a standard triangulation language (STL) file. These are 
the standard input file formats accepted by any AM machine. The STL file format is the 
representation of the CAD model by a series of triangles.
3.
The third step is the slicing process of the STL or AMF files. Before the slicing process is 
commenced, the part orientation is optimized for the building process based on various 
optimization parameters, which include the ease of building with no or minimal support 
structure and minimum building time.
4.
The fourth step is the actual component building process.
5.
The fifth step is the removal of the component from the build platform when the building 
process is completed.
6.
Lastly, the support structures are removed, the part is cleaned up.

Big Data
Big Data is nothing but lots of data consisting of varieties of data. It is the concept of
gathering useful insights from such voluminous amounts of structured, semi-structured and
unstructured data that can be used for effective decision making in the business
environment. This data is collected from various sources over a course of time and is
cumbersome (heavy and difficult to carry/use) to be managed by traditional database
tools.
14
Big data is a voluminous set 
of structured, unstructured, 
and semi-structured 
datasets, which is 
challenging to manage using 
traditional data processing 
tools. It requires additional 
infrastructure to govern, 
analyze, and convert into 
insights.

15
Big data?
Big data is a combination 
of unstructured, semi-structured or structured 
data collected by organizations. These data 
sets can be mined to gain insights and used 
in machine learning projects, predictive 
modeling and other advanced analytics 
applications.
Big data can be used to improve operations, 
provide better customer service and create 
personalized marketing campaigns -- all of 
which can increase value for an organization. 
As an example, big data analytics can provide 
companies with valuable insights (a deep 
understanding) into their customers that 
can then be used to refine marketing 
techniques to increase customer 
engagement and conversion rates
Semi-structured data is a 
combination of structured and 
unstructured data and shares 
characteristics of both

BIG DATA ANALYTICS
It is a process to store and examine large volume of data from various sources and systematically 
extract information from that.
•
Big data analytics 
describes the process of 
uncovering trends, 
patterns, and 
correlations in large 
amounts of raw data to 
help make data-
informed decisions.
•
Provides various 
advantages—it can be 
used for better decision 
making, preventing 
fraudulent activities, 
among other things.
•
Is used to extract 
meaningful insights, 
such as hidden 
patterns, unknown 
correlations, market 
trends, and customer 
preferences.
•
Descriptive analytics: 
Allows us to find out what 
happened and when.
•
Diagnostic analytics: 
Explains why and how 
something happened by 
identifying patterns and 
relationships in available 
data.
•
Predictive analytics: Uses 
historical data to 
uncover patterns and 
make predictions on 
what’s likely to happen 
in the future.

Provides specific 
recommendations on 
what should be done 
better.
17

BIG DATA CHARACTERISTICS
•
Big Data describes large sets of diverse structured, 
unstructured, and semi-structured data that are 
continuously generated at a high speed and in 
high volumes.
•
However, to understand Big Data, we need to get 
acquainted with its attributes known as the Five 
V’s:
1.
Volume: This relates to terabytes to petabytes of 
information coming from a range of sources such 
as IoT devices, social media, text files, business 
transactions, etc.
2.
Velocity: Is the speed at which the data is 
generated and processed. It’s represented in terms 
of batch reporting, near real-time/real-time 
processing, and data streaming.
3.
Variety: Is the vector showing the diversity of Big 
Data, showcasing that it isn’t just about structured 
data that resides within relational databases as 
rows and columns.
4.
Veracity: Is the measure of how truthful, accurate, 
and reliable data is and what value it brings as it 
can be incomplete, inconsistent, or noisy thus 
decreasing the accuracy of the analytics process. 
Due to this, data veracity is commonly classified as 
good, bad, and undefined. 
Data in industry 4.0 is generated from 
multiple diverse sources:
1) Product and machine design data
2) Data from control systems
3) Staff work monitoring video data
4) System monitoring data
5) Environmental data
6) Product usage data
7) Fault detection data
8) User feedback data
Benefits of Big Data

Characteristics of Big data- The five V’s are Volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value.
The Volume of data: The Volume of data has expanded exponentially over the last few years. This data can be 
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured, and it focuses on the sheer amount of data rather than its content. The 
main challenges of managing huge data include storage limitations, processing power requirements, and bandwidth 
capabilities.
The velocity of data: Time is an important factor when assessing big data as new information emerges continuously 
throughout the day. Data is generated rapidly, and big data velocity determines the pace at which it is collected from 
the real world. With everyone coming into the Information Age and producing data at high speeds, the velocity of 
data is increasing exponentially. The problem with this is that we can’t handle the amount of data coming in.
This led to a need for data processing. Electronic Data processing is the streamlining of data. The more complicated 
solution is data investment, which involves making sense of the vast amount of data we have received lately to make 
accurate decisions.
Variety of Data: Along with Volume and velocity, the diversity of big data or different data types such as images, 
videos, etc., presents a unique challenge for organizations to manage their wide range of content effectively. It was 
reported that more than 90% of the world’s data was created in the last two years alone. This creates a challenge 
because there are too many data sources and it’s not properly organized and managed.
The veracity of Data: Big Data contains large quantities of ambiguous and dirty (unverified) data that needs to be 
cleaned and organized before serving its purpose. Semi-Structured data, for example, is often incomplete or 
inaccurate, which makes data cleansing a challenging process.

22
Value of Data: While the other V(s) represent 
external factors affecting big data, the value 
represents the internal factors associated with 
business strategy and execution. To extract maximum 
value from Big Data, companies and data scientists 
need to have a clear goal for what they want to achieve 
through their analysis. Once this is established, they 
can determine which information needs to be collected 
and how it will be used.

23

HOW BIG DATA ANALYTICS WORK?:
1.
Collect Data: Data collection looks different for every organization, 
as they gather both structured and unstructured data from a variety 
of sources like cloud storage to mobile applications to in-store IoT 
sensors and beyond.
2.
Process Data: Once data is collected and stored, it must be 
organized properly to get accurate results on analytical queries, 
especially when it’s large and unstructured. 
•
Batch processing is useful when there is a longer turnaround time between 
collecting and analyzing data. 
•
Stream processing looks at small batches of data at once, shortening the 
delay time between collection and analysis for quicker decision-making. 
3.
Clean Data: Data big or small requires scrubbing to improve data 
quality and get stronger results; all data must be formatted correctly, 
and any duplicative or irrelevant data must be eliminated. Dirty data 
can obscure and mislead, creating flawed insights.
4.
Analyze Data: Getting big data into a usable state takes time. Once 
it’s ready, advanced analytics processes can turn big data into big 
insights. Some of these big data analysis methods include:
•
Data mining sorts through large datasets to identify patterns and 
relationships by identifying anomalies and creating data clusters.
•
Predictive analytics uses an organization’s historical data to make 
predictions about the future, identifying upcoming risks and opportunities.
•
Deep learning imitates human learning patterns by using AI and ML to 
layer algorithms and find patterns in the most complex and abstract data.
•
ML and AI tap various algorithms to analyze large data sets.

Cyber Physical Systems
A cyber-physical system (CPS) is an engineered system that 
integrates physical components with computation. CPSs are 
designed to sense the state of the system and environment, provide 
feedback for controlling the system, and perform real-time sensing 
and dynamic control.
Cyber Physical system (CPS) is a new generation of digital systems, 
composed of computational and physical capability that engages 
with humans like never before. It's designed to act like a network of 
multiple variables with both physical input and output – rather than 
standalone technology.
25

Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are interconnected systems that combine 
physical and computational elements. They are used in many fields, including 
government operations, critical infrastructure, and daily life. Here are some 
examples of CPS:
Smart buildings: Building management systems (BMS) monitor, manage, and 
control systems like HVAC, electricity, security, and fire safety. This can help 
buildings operate more efficiently and save energy.
Smart grids: These systems can be vulnerable to attacks that cause blackouts.
Autonomous vehicles: These systems can be hijacked by attackers, which 
could lead to accidents.
Medical devices: These systems can be vulnerable to cyber-spies and insider 
attacks
26

CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) are integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes. They are automated systems that 
enable connection of the operations of the physical reality with computing and communication infrastructures.
•
Sensing and actuation components: It allow a CPS to interact with the physical world involving embedded sensors that measure 
parameters like temperature or pressure. The data collected by these sensor networks must be processed and communicated to 
other parts of the system, so that appropriate decisions can be made.
•
Information processing and communication components: These are necessary to decide how to actuate on the physical system. 
The processed data must then be communicated to other parts of the system to take appropriate actions.
•
Control components: It could involve a controller that regulates the flow of information and controls the system’s actuation. The 
control component must be designed to ensure that the system meets its objectives while considering uncertainties in the 
physical world.
•
Interfaces with humans: It allow people to interact with the information system using a graphical user interface that enables users 
to monitor the system and input commands. 
27

•
A CPS consists of a control unit, usually one or more microcontroller(s), which 
control(s) the sensors and actuators that are necessary to interact with the real 
world, and processes the data obtained.
•
These embedded systems also require a communication interface to 
exchange data with other embedded systems or a cloud.
•
The data exchange is the most important feature of a CPS, since the data can 
be linked and evaluated centrally.
•
The processes allied with CPS include devices and buildings, medical 
processes, coordination and logistics, and transportation routes and systems.
•
CPS enables internet-enabled physical objects with integrated computers and control elements. This allows for self-monitoring, data 
production, and communication with other entities. Digital twins play a significant role, where virtual replicas of objects facilitate data 
analysis and provide real-time visibility of specialized records and processes.
•
IoT and CPS have different origins, with IoT rooted in networking and IT, while CPS is driven by systems engineering and control. CPS 
applications contribute to energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. IoT use cases span across various industries, 
including healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing, with applications in track and trace options and structural health monitoring.
•
To maximize the benefits of CPS, effective communication between hardware and software components is crucial. The use of AI can 
automate decision-making processes and allow employees to focus on situations that require their attention. The successful 
implementation of CPS relies on a hub for data interchange and collection, enhancing production processes with automation and 
knowledge integration.
28

An embedded system is a computational system embedded within a physical system. An interface to the Internet or a similar network is 
necessary to extend an embedded system to a CPS.
IMPLEMENTATION OF CPS WITH INDUSTRY 4.0
Direct System Extension:
•
Here, the embedded system, is extended by a communication interface 
to access the Internet and the software is changed accordingly to 
enable communication over the internet, e.g. with the cloud.
•
To this end, all the sensor signals of the system must be transmitted by the 
control unit to the cloud. 
•
Methods should be implemented to control the actuators via Internet.
System Expansion by Microcontroller Board:
•
Here, microcontroller board that has the various communication 
interfaces such as CAN, UART, WLAN, Ethernet, etc. is developed.
•
This is connected to the embedded system which takes over the 
communication to the Internet or a cloud via uniform interfaces, over 
which the board can be connected to the embedded system.
•
The software of the board must be adjusted separately to each system.
•
Only the mapping is to be reworked accordingly so that it is relatively easy 
to transfer this variant to other systems.
Extension by Smart Actuators and Sensors:
•
Traditionally control unit assumes the signal processing function.
•
The sensors take over the processing of the signal and the actuators 
independently check their current status, and correct it, if necessary.
•
These sensors transmit their data to a central control unit via field buses.
•
To extend such a system to a CPS, data is sent from the sensors and 
actuators, to a cloud, and process it there.
•
However, a high data volume is the result here and the cost of smart 
sensors and actuators must not be underestimated.

INDUSTRY 4.0 FRAMEWORK CHALLENEGS
Digital transformation is a complex task for 
companies, requiring a lot of resources, a strategy, 
etc. Change management has been researched 
for many years, but there isn’t a unified strategy to 
manage such complex projects.
The implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies 
also depends on the groundwork done in the 
company’s ICT architecture. Excellence in IT is 
both a driver and a key enabler of the digital
transformation.
A theoretical framework to asses the managerial 
challenges of implementing Industry 4.0 solutions is 
shown on the left.
The basic concept of IoT is a global network of 
machines and devices that can interact with 
each other . Both physical products and services
are needed to implement IoT applications. IoT in 
Industrial companies can further be divided into 
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).
71

CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING IOT
IoT Security:
IoT devices have been notoriously 
vulnerable to cyber attacks. There are 
countless examples of IoT devices 
being incorporated into botnets or 
being hacked to misuse or access 
other parts of a network.
Coverage:
IoT devices need network 
connection to transmit and receive 
data. Loosing device connection 
looses devices capabilities. IoT 
connectivity depends on coverage 
types. Hence solutions limit 
deployment. 
Scalability:
The largest IoT 
manufacturers have 
millions of devices 
deployed around
the world. As businesses 
scale, they often 
piecemeal together their 
IoT stack, adopting 
different connectivity 
solutions for deployments 
in new regions.
Each of these comes with 
different management 
platforms, support
systems, and underlying 
technologies. The
larger the scale of your 
operations, the more 
overwhelming device
management, and 
logistics become.
72

Interoperability:
Not all IoT devices and solutions are
compatible with each other or with your 
business applications. Adding
new hardware and software to the mix 
may require you to make a chain
reaction of changes to keep the 
functionality you need while
accommodating the new tech.
Bandwidth Availability:
Radio Frequency bandwidth is a finite resource the entire 
world has to share. Even with billions of connected devices, 
there’s more than enough to go around. But when too 
many of these devices use the same frequency bands in 
the same location, their signals interfere with each other.
Limited Battery Life:
Most IoT devices have small batteries. This is mainly because 
the devices are often incredibly small. Larger batteries 
could restrict a device’s use cases or limit where and how 
the device can be installed. 
Remote Access:
The type of connectivity an IoT device uses can change 
how you’re able to access the device. For example, using 
your customers’ WiFi or ethernet requires support personnel 
to either have VPN privileges or be on the premises. On-site 
visits are extremely expensive, but if that’s the only way a 
technician can troubleshoot or update your device, you’re 
stuck paying the additional costs.
73

CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING CLOUD COMPUTING
Data Security and Privacy:
Data security is a major concern when 
switching to cloud computing. User or 
organizational data stored in the cloud 
is critical and private. Even if the cloud 
service provider assures data integrity, 
it is your responsibility to carry out user 
authentication and authorization, 
identity management, data 
encryption, and access control.
Multi-Cloud Environments:
Due to an increase in the options to 
the companies, enterprises not only 
use a single cloud but depend on 
multiple cloud service providers. Most 
of these companies use hybrid cloud 
tactics and close to 84% are 
dependent on multiple clouds. This 
ends up being hindered and difficult 
to manage for the infrastructure team.
Performance Challenges:
Performance is an important factor 
while considering cloud-based 
solutions. If the performance of the 
cloud is not satisfactory, it can drive 
away users and decrease profits. Even 
a little latency while loading an app or 
a web page can result in a huge drop 
in the percentage of users.
Cost Management:
Even as almost all cloud service 
providers have a “Pay As You Go”
model, which reduces the overall cost 
of the resources being used,
there are times when there are huge 
costs incurred to the enterprise
using cloud computing.
CHALLENGES IN 
IMPLEMENTING 
CLOUD 
COMPUTING
74

Interoperability and Flexibility:
When an organization uses a 
specific cloud service provider 
and wants to switch to another 
cloud-based solution, it often 
turns up to be a tedious 
procedure since applications 
written for one cloud with the 
application stack are required 
to be re-written for the other 
cloud. There is a lack of 
flexibility from switching from 
one cloud to another due to 
the complexities involved.
High Dependence on 
Network:
Since cloud computing 
deals with provisioning 
resources in real-time, it 
deals with enormous 
amounts of data transfer 
to and from the servers. 
This is only made possible 
due to the availability of 
the high speed network.
Lack of Knowledge 
and Expertise:
Due to complex nature 
and high demand for 
research working with 
the cloud, it becomes 
a tedious task requiring 
immense knowledge 
and wide expertise on 
the subject.
75

Some of the Big Data challenges are:
• Sharing and Accessing Data:
The most frequent challenge in big data efforts is the 
inaccessibility of data sets from external sources. Sharing 
data can cause substantial challenges. Accessing data 
from public repositories leads to multiple difficulties.
• Privacy and Security:
It is another most important challenge with Big Data. This 
challenge includes sensitive, conceptual, technical as 
well as legal significance. Most of the organizations are 
unable to maintain regular checks due to large amounts 
of data generation. 
• Analytical Challenges:
Analytical challenges like very large data volume, find 
data points, using data to best advantage.
• Technical Challenges:
Data Quality, Data Storage costs, etc.
• Fault Tolerance:
Fault tolerance computing is extremely hard, involving 
intricate algorithms
• Scalability:
Big data projects can grow and evolve rapidly. The 
scalability issue of Big Data has lead towards cloud 
computing.

DIGITAL AND HUMAN WORKSPACE:
A digital workspace is an integrated technology framework that centralizes the management of an 
enterprise's applications, data and endpoints, allowing employees to collaborate and work remotely.
Benefits of Digital Workspace:
•
Flexibility: Virtual desktops and other digital workspace technology allow employees to work wherever and whenever they 
want, on whichever device they prefer. This provides workers with a greater sense of control over their lives since their work life and 
personal life.
•
Productivity: Flexibility benefits also encourages increased employee productivity as they are less likely to take sick days since 
they aren't required to come into an office.
•
Improved Collaboration: A digital workspace encourages easy, interactions between coworkers and supervisors. Links, 
data, documents and images can be easily shared, and employees can work on projects together regardless of their physical 
location. 
•
High Retention Rates: The empowerment that comes from increased flexibility also helps workers trust and respect their 
superiors and feel like they are trusted and respected in return. This increases employee satisfaction and makes it more likely that 
workers will commit to and remain with the company for extended periods of time.
•
Better Customer Service: The digital workspace often incorporates technologies that offer self-service education and 
analytics. These, in addition to a strong employee experience, can elevate the level of customer service provided by employees.
•
Reduced Costs: Since a digital workspace eliminates the need for a physical work environment, companies can benefit by 
saving on previous expenses.
Features of Digital Workspace:
•
Provides users with self-service, cross platform scalability, device-ownership models.
•
Brings all resources – OS’es, files, apps, into one place providing a cloud based console for ease of management.
•
Provides single-sign-on(SSO) for identity authentication and secure file sharing across organization endpoints.
82

Challenges of a Digital Workspace:
•
Digital Workspace lacks central notification provisions:
•
Here, notifications are spread across various systems and apps. This results in email inbox being primary 
notification centre for digital workspaces. Efficiency is decreased throughout the workforce since more time 
and energy is required to track events.
•
Security Challenges:
•
The digital workspace increases the number of applications and systems being used as well as the amount 
of sharing that occurs. This creates a need for stronger and more scalable security that allows users to 
collaborate with external partners securely. But, securing and managing data produced through this 
external collaboration is one of the biggest challenges in the digital workspace. 
•
Training and Adoption Challenges:
•
Users often complain that they are not provided with proper training when new systems are introduced and, 
therefore, do not know how to leverage the technology to improve their work processes. On the other 
hand, employees often do not have enough time to provide or attend these training sessions while 
continuing to manage their daily responsibilities. As a result, users often provide negative feedback when 
asked about training processes. 
•
Inadequate & Incomplete Search Interface in Digital Workspace:
•
Information within the digital workspace platform is often split across multiple systems without a centralized 
index. So, search queries may not display all related or relevant material.
83

A crucial part of the underlying 
architecture for a digital workspace is 
unified endpoint management (UEM), a 
centralized approach to securing and 
controlling desktop computers, laptops, 
smartphones in a connected, cohesive 
manner from a single console.

84

How to Implement a successful Digital Workspace:
•
Vision: The digital workspace should not be 
implemented until the company - including 
stakeholders and business, HR and facilities 
managers - comes to a clear agreement on the 
purpose and goal of the platform. 
•
Strategy: A digital workspace strategy should 
be created to guide initiatives and changes 
within research and development, 
manufacturing, marketing, sales, customer 
support, IT and human resources (HR). 
•
Employee Experience: Consider how a digital 
workspace can be used to strengthen the 
company's employee experience; this will, in 
turn, improve customer service.
•
Employee Personas: The systems used by HR are 
likely very different from the technology used by 
DevOps. However, personas also include factors 
such as an employee's mobile use while 
working, technology consumption, 
organizational knowledge, collaboration needs 
and content creation responsibilities.
85

•
Digital Security: The combination of social media, 
and cloud computing technologies increases the 
risk of data security issues. Technologies and 
procedures must be implemented to ensure the 
protection of data in the cloud.
•
Business Applications: Each application should 
help business processes in some way. Knowledge 
management (KM) and collaboration platforms 
are two essential applications. 
•
Compatibility: A successful digital workspace 
allows employees to use any internet-connected 
device to access business applications. 
•
Mobility: Users can access the business 
applications from wherever they choose to work 
and at any time of day.
•
Communication Infrastructure: A digital 
workspace must manage simultaneous data, 
video and voice communications occurring both 
inside and outside the company's network.
•
Telecommunication Tools: Includes real-time video 
conferencing and voice calling services.
86

DIGITAL TWIN
A digital twin is a virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object. It is a virtual 
representation of a real-world entity or process.  It is composed of three primary elements:
•
A physical entity in real space;
•
Digital twin in software form(virtual representation)
•
Data that links the first two elements together.
Difference between digital twin and simulators:
•
Simulations and digital twins both utilize digital 
models to replicate a system’s various 
processes, a digital twin is actually a virtual 
environment, which makes it considerably 
richer for study.
•
While a simulation typically studies one 
particular process, a digital twin can itself run 
any number of useful simulations in order to 
study multiple processes.
•
Digital twins are designed around a two-way 
flow of information that first occurs when object 
sensors provide relevant data to the system 
processor and then happens again when 
insights created by the processor are shared 
back with the original source object.
87

Essential Properties related to digital twin
•
A digital twin functions as a proxy for the 
current state of the thing it represents. It also 
is unique to the thing represented, not simply 
generic to the category. Moreover, the 
digital twins of two seemingly identical 
products will not usually be identical.
•
While many digital twins have a 2D or 3D 
computer-aided design (CAD) image 
associated with them, visual representation is 
not a prerequisite. The digital representation, 
or digital model, could consist of a database, 
a set of equations or a spreadsheet. 
•
The data link, often but not necessarily two-
way, is what differentiates digital twins from 
similar concepts. This link makes it possible for 
users to investigate the state of the object or 
process by querying the data, and for 
actions communicated through the digital 
twin to take effect in its physical counterpart.
Key Aspects of Digital Twin Technology:
•
Synchronization: To make sure the digital twin 
and the represented entity mirror each other as 
closely as possible. 
•
Frequency/Speed: At which data is updated in a 
digital twin varies enormously, purpose wise.
•
Fidelity: Degree of precision of & accuracy of 
virtual representation and sync mechanism. 
88

Types of digital twin
Components / Parts Twin:
Component twins are the basic 
unit of digital twin, the smallest 
example of a functioning 
component. Parts twins are 
roughly the same thing, but 
pertain to components of slightly 
less importance. 
89

Asset twins (product). Two or more 
components whose interaction is 
represented in the digital twin.
System twins (unit). Assets assembled into a 
complete, functioning unit
Process twins. Systems working together to 
serve a larger goal.
90

Benefits of digital twin
•
Because they're virtual, digital twins can 
reduce the cost and risk of having to work on 
the physical things they represent. 
•
Improved operational efficiency from having 
more timely data and faster, more effective 
production; 
•
More effective and less expensive R&D from 
replacing physical prototypes, which can be 
expensive and hard to modify, with virtual 
prototypes that are more flexible and 
produce more data;
•
Longer uptime for equipment because 
maintenance issues can be investigated in a 
single digital twin instead of having to shut 
down all the equipment to isolate a problem;
•
Improved product end-of-life processes, such 
as refurbishment and recycling, thanks to 
more accurate information about the age 
and contents of a product. 
Digital twin Interoperability
•
While they usually start in CAD and 
PLM, some digital twins are also 
managed in ERP and material 
requirements planning (MRP) software.
•
ERP and MRP store the bill of materials 
(BOM), a comprehensive inventory of 
the materials and parts needed to 
make a product and typically a major 
contributor of digital twin data. ERP 
and MRP together also run many of the 
supply chain and production 
processes that go into manufacturing 
a product. 
•
Another common source of digital twin 
data is the manufacturing execution 
system (MES) that many companies 
use to monitor, control and optimize 
production systems on the factory 
floor.
91

Challenges of Digital twin
•
Data Management: Data cleansing is often 
needed to make data from a CAD model or 
IoT sensor usable in a digital twin. A data lake 
might need to be established to manage the 
digital twin data and perform analytics on it. 
Deciding who owns the data is another 
problem. 
•
Supplier collaboration: The numerous 
participants in a supply chain must be willing 
to share information from their own production 
processes to ensure that the information in a 
digital twin is complete.
•
Complexity. The data collected in the 
different software applications used by a 
manufacturer and its suppliers is not only 
voluminous, it changes often. Last-minute 
design changes, for example, must make it 
into the final version of the twin so the 
customer and manufacturer have the most 
current information. 
•
System integration: Digital twins often begin life 
in CAD software but get more use in PLM, 
where they're used in post-sale services, such as 
performance monitoring and equipment 
maintenance. Numerous CAD and PLM 
software vendors have one-to-one integrations, 
but it isn't always adequate and smaller 
vendors may have no built-in integration. 
•
Data Security: Digital twin data is timely and 
mission critical, but it also travels through 
several networks and software applications, 
which makes securing it at every stage 
challenging. 
•
IoT Development: As the preferred data source 
for most of the real-time and historical data 
about an entity or process, IoT sensors are 
usually a basic requirement of digital twins. 
Implementing IoT presents big challenges in 
network infrastructure and storage capacity, 
device and data security, and device 
management. 
92

Digital twin market and Industries
•
Physically large projects: Buildings, bridges 
and other complex structures bound by strict 
rules of engineering. 
•
Mechanically complex projects: Jet turbines, 
automobiles and aircraft. Digital twins can 
help improve efficiency within complicated 
machinery and mammoth engines. 
•
Power equipment: This includes both the 
mechanisms for generating power and 
transmitting it. 
•
Manufacturing projects: Digital twins excel at 
helping streamline process efficiency, as you 
would find in industrial environments with co-
functioning machine systems.
93

Applications of Digital twin
•
Power-generation equipment: Large 
engines—including jet engines, locomotive 
engines and power-generation turbines—
benefit tremendously from the use of digital 
twins, especially for helping to establish 
timeframes for regularly needed 
maintenance. 
•
Structures and their systems: Big physical 
structures, such as large buildings or offshore 
drilling platforms, can be improved through 
digital twins, particularly during their design. 
Also useful in designing the systems operating 
within those structures, such as HVAC systems.
94

•
Manufacturing operations: Since digital twins are 
meant to mirror a product’s entire lifecycle, it’s 
not surprising that digital twins have become 
ubiquitous in all stages of manufacturing, guiding 
products from design to finished product, and all 
steps in between.
•
Healthcare services: Just as products can be 
profiled through the use of digital twins, so can 
patients receiving healthcare services. The same 
type system of sensor-generated data can be 
used to track a variety of health indicators and 
generate key insights.
95

•
Automotive industry: Cars represent many types 
of complex, co-functioning systems, and digital 
twins are used extensively in auto design, both to 
improve vehicle performance and increase the 
efficiency surrounding their production. ●Urban 
planning.
•
Civil engineers and others involved in urban 
planning activities are aided significantly by the 
use of digital twins, which can show 3D and 4D 
spatial data in real time and also incorporate 
augmented reality systems into built 
environments.
96

Future of Digital twin
The future of digital twins is nearly 
limitless, due to the fact that 
increasing amounts of cognitive 
power are constantly being 
devoted to their use. So digital 
twins are constantly learning new 
skills and capabilities, which 
means they can continue to 
generate the insights needed to 
make products better and 
processes more efficient.
97

AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS
Robots are programmable machines that are usually able to carry out a series of actions 
autonomously or semi-autonomously. An autonomous robot is a robot that can perform tasks 
without human intervention. 
The integration of flexible and cooperative 
autonomous robots provide manufacturers with a 
broadened range of services to accomplish complex 
tasks. Sometimes referred to as “cobots”, autonomous 
robots in smart factories work alongside humans and 
interact with other factory technology. 
They often have sophisticated features that can help 
them understand their physical environment and 
automate parts of their maintenance and direction
98

Robot:
1. Robots are mechanical devices that can automatically perform specific operation 
2. This can be controlled by an external control devices or a built-in control device 
3. The shape of robots is given depending upon its characteristics and purposes of the work 
4. It can be used for monotonous, repetitive, tedious, and dangerous jobs that exist in industrial sites 
5. It is extensively used at places where human being cannot reach. 
Basic Objective of Designing Robots:
