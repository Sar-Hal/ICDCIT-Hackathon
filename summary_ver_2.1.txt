WHAT ARE 
MATHEMATICAL 
MATERIALS 
Numbers 
Expressions involving basic arithmetic operations, 
variables, parameters, and constants used in 
mathematical models
Functions that work like mathematical operators 
Subscripts and superscripts in a series of variables
Equations 

CONSISTENCY 
IN WRITING
Consistency should be maintained throughout 
text e. g. writing 5000 in two places like this:
0.05 × 105 in one place and 0.5 × 104 in another, 
is inconsistent practice
Consistently, it should be stated as 5 × 103

SI (Engineering) 
& Scientific 
Notation of 
Numbers
a × 10b
a: Coefficient, 10: Base, b: Exponent
SI (Engineering) Notation
b takes values 0, 3, 6, 9, . . and –3, –6, . . .
Scientific Notation
0 < a < 10

SI Notation of 
Numbers
Standard 
Scientific 
Notation
525 is written as 0.525 × 103 
0.005 is written as 5 × 10–3
Standard scientific notations are preferred to 
computer exponentials e. g. 5.0 × 10−3 instead of 
5.0 E−3
Computer exponentials (using E) appearing in 
computer output may be given in Appendixes, 
but not in main text
25.5 is represented as  2.55 × 101
0.055 is represented as 5.5 × 10-2

USE OF 
% SYMBOL
COMPUND 
NUMBERS
% symbol is used with Indo-Arabic numbers
‘Per cent’ is used with word version of number e. g. 
5 % and five per cent (not 5 per cent)
% symbol is not repeated with each number in a 
series or with each number in a range of values e. g. 
5, 10, and 15 %, OR 5–10 %
Hyphen separates individual numbers of compound 
number and their ordinal counterparts e. g. twenty-
one, thirty-four, . . . twenty-first, thirty-fourth, . . .

NUMERALS 
OR 
WORDS?
Numbers (nine or less) should be written in words e. g. 
We carried out two experiments . . . 
If a series of numbers contain numbers both less and 
more than 10, then only Arabic numerals should be used 
e. g. There are 25 samples, with a sample size of 5.
Marks secured by the students are: 2, 5, 10, and 15.
Exception:We assume that x is greater than 1.

THOUSAND 
OPERATOR
NUMBER OF 
MATHEMATICAL 
OPERATIONS
For very large and very small numbers, give a space 
in the thousand operator e. g. 10 000 000, 0.254 25
Always use figures when symbol of unit of 
measurement follows e. g. 5 A
Use figures when mathematical operations are 
implied e. g. factor of 2,   3 × 3 matrix

ROUND 
NUMBERS
APPROXIMATE 
VALUES
Always spell approximate values, ‘round numbers’ 
e. g. about five years, two orders of magnitude, 
about four times larger 
If approximate value is followed by a unit, then 
the unit is not expressed in symbols e. g. several 
kilovolts, a few tens of megahertz, a few volts 

MODIFICATION 
OF NOUN
Units of measurement are nouns and should not 
be used to modify another noun:
Incorrect:The signal generator had a 15-kHz 
frequency. 
Correct: The signal generator had a frequency of 
15 kHz. 
Incorrect: It is a 6-centimeter long pipe.
Correct: The length of the pipe is 6 cm.

LIST OF 
SYMBOLS

Research document should contain list of symbols in the 
beginning

List of symbols helps to 
o To ensure that same symbol is neither used for more than 
one purpose nor defined in more than one way
o Reader to refer to one place to find definition of a symbol

List of symbols should be arranged with Latin letters 
followed by Greek letters, each arranged alphabetically

Whenever applicable, unit of measure should be given for 
each symbol: 
c: 
Velocity (km/h)
m: 
Mass (kg)
. . .
β: Regression coefficient (unit/rupee)
η: Efficiency (1)

BASIC 
ARITHMETIC 
OPERATIONS

Signs for basic arithmetic operations:
Plus 
+ 
Minus
−  (different from hyphen - look at length, 
vertical location, and intensity) 
Multiplication
× (different from the letter x or symbol 
asterisk *)
Division 
∕  (different from solidus i. e. slash or 
oblique / look at the inclination) and ÷

Except plus symbol, no symbol is available on a keyboard 
normally available in the market  

All other symbols are to be selected from Symbols list

SCALARS, 
VECTORS, 
AND 
MATRICES

Scalars, vectors, and matrices are written as follows:
scalar:
lightface italic (v, l, m, … )
vector: 
boldface, lower-case (v, l, m, … )
matrix:
boldface, upper-case (V, L, . . .)
tensor:
boldface, italic (V, L)

Purpose of italicizing scalars is to distinguish them from SI 
units that are always written upright

VARIABLES 
& 
CONSTANTS

Symbols for variables, constants, and unknown quantities 
are italicized e. g. x, l, m

Greek letters ( α, β, etc.) are always written upright

Greek letters ( α, β, etc.) are always set in Roman

Subscripted variables follow different writing styles:
Subscripts are numbers:
x1, x2
Subscripts are variables:
xi, xij

Subscript is upright when it refers to input or output variable 
or entities
other than a quantity e. g. xi (input variable), xo (output 
variable), xe (mass of electron)

Subscript is upright when it refers to values of upper and 
lower limits or maximum and minimum values e. g. xu and xl , 
xmax and xmin

Abbreviations for standard functions, such as log, 
max, min, exp, sin, cos, tan, cosh, lim, avg, cov, 
diag, and ln, are set in Roman (upright)
A space separates function name from expression 
e. g. log x, sin (x + y), . . . 
Operators for expectation and transposition are in 
italic e. g. E and T
FUNCTIONS 
& 
OPERATORS

Transpose of a vector
xT(n)
not 
x(n)T
Power of a scalar
x2(n)
not 
x(n)2
Vertical alignment of superscript and subscript
not 
Indexing a subscripted variable: 
not  
SUPERSCRIPTS

USE 
OF 
ELLIPSES
Ellipsis indicate omitted words, sentences, or symbols
Ellipses indicate a series of variables e. g. 
x1, x2, . . ., xn
(not  x1, x2 . . . xn)
Three raised ellipses (centered dots) are used for 
series of additions or multiplications of variables e. g. 
x1 + x2 + · · · + xn
(not  x1 + x2 + . . . xn)
x1x2 · · · xn
(not  x1x2 . . . xn)
Three ellipses indicate range of  variable e. g. 
xi, i = 1, 2, . . . 
(not xi, i = 1, 2 . . .)


One space should be provided on both sides of a mathematical 
operator
z = x + y
z = x −y
z = x × y
z = x ÷ y

No space appears if division is indicated by the symbol  ∕  and also 
when multiplication is implied
z = x∕y
z = xy
z = 25x
Negative number should not have space separating sign and number
The number −2 (not − 2) is more than −3 (not − 3).
−3 < −2 (correct)
− 3 < − 2 (not correct)
When plus sign indicates positive number then no space appears 
between sign and number
−3 ≤x ≤+3
No space appears between a variable and its subscripts (or 
superscripts) and between a variable and its power

REFERENCING 
EQUATIONS

Each equation should appear immediately after it is 
referenced in text for first time

Explanation for each equation should appear in text that 
precedes it

Explanation should define important variables and their 
relationships that lead to equation

Subsequent referencing takes place by citing equation 
number
All symbols appearing in equation should be defined 
immediately after
Symbols should be sequenced in order of their appearance 
in equation

measure (wherever applicable)

EXPLANATION 
OF TERMS
EQUATION 
NUMBER
LOCATION OF 
EQUATION
A long equation can have many terms, each representing a 
particular aspect of theme of equation
Each term should be explained before or immediately after 
equation
***
Equations are referred to in text by equation numbers
Equations are numbered in order of appearance (like tables and 
figures)
When document is divided into chapters, equation number bears 
chapter number and number reflecting order of appearance
***
Equation should be separated from texts preceding and following it 
by a larger line spacing (compared to one in text)
It should be set off from left margin with an indentation 
Equation numbers should be right justified and should be preceded 
by three raised ellipses

EXAMPLES

Number of students (z) in class is given in Eq. 4.2 as sum 
of number of male students (x) and number of female 
students (y):
z = x + y
· · · (4.2)

This equation is second in order of appearance in Chapter 
4 of document

Note abbreviation “Eq.” used in text preceding equation
Concentration = (ma’ + b) × dilution factor
where a’: 
unknown sample absorption
m:
slope of calibration graph
b:
intercept on concentration axis
Note: ‘where’ is not capitalized

PUNCTUATION
Equations should be punctuated as a sentence e. g. 

Defining y as a quadratic function of x,

y = ax + bx2,
· · ·
(3)

the gradient of y is given as

.
· · ·

Note: commas, full stop, raised dots, vertical alignments

PARAMETERS 
IN 
EQUATIONS
EQUATION IN 
TEXT LINE
Not numbers but parameters appear in equations (because 
they are estimated values and not constants):
Not recommended:
z = x + 2
Recommended: 
z = x + y
y = 2
A numbered equation should not appear in a line in the text  
Incorrect: It thus comes out to be true that x2 + y = x + y2
· · 
· (4.3)
Correct: Thus the following equation holds:
x2 + y = x + y2
· · · (4.3)

BREAKING 
EQUATIONS

Long equation may not fit in one line, and may be broken in 
two ways:
before verb operator (such as =, ≠, <, >, ≤, ≥) or
before conjunction  (such as +, ×) that follows an aggregation (i. 
e. meaningful expression within brackets)

In first case, run-over lines are aligned on verb operators 

In second case, conjunction on run-over line is lined up with 
right of verb in line above
Example:
 
z = (x + y – ef + r)
  
      + 2y – ef + r
           – (e – f) 
Verb Operator
(x + y – ef + r)
< (2y – ef + r) 
conjunction on run-over line 

USE OF 
NUMBERS IN 
SENTENCES

Provide numerical values and avoid ambiguous words
Incorrect: The voltage across a forward-biased silicon diode 
is small.
Correct: The voltage across a forward-biased silicon diode is 
about 0.7 V. 
Correct: The voltage across a forward-biased silicon diode is 
small (about 0.7 V).

Avoid dangling comparatives and superlatives
Incorrect: The voltage across the diode is smaller. 
Correct: The voltage across the diode is smaller than the 
voltage across resistor R1.

ORDERS OF 
MAGNITUDE
Same ‘order of magnitude’ means their ratio is less 
than ten e. g. 5 and 45 are of same order of 
magnitude
An order of magnitude larger means ten times as 
large e. g. 125 is an order of magnitude larger than 
10
Two orders of magnitude larger means 100 times 
larger e. g. 825 is two orders of magnitude larger 
than 7
