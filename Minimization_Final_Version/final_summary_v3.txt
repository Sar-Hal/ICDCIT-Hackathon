Here's a summary of the key educational concepts from the provided text section:

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Definition of Biosensors**: A biosensor is a device that detects biological interactions, such as enzyme-substrate reactions or antigen-antibody binding.
2. **Components of a Biosensor**: A biosensor consists of a biological element (e.g., enzyme, antibody), a transducer, and an amplifier/detector.
3. **Working Principle of Biosensors**: Biosensors work by converting a biological interaction into a measurable signal, such as an electrical current or optical signal.
4. **Types of Biosensors**: Based on the transducing mechanism, biosensors can be classified into:
	* Resonant biosensors
	* Optical detection biosensors
	* Thermal detection biosensors
	* Electrochemical biosensors
	* Ion-selective biosensors
5. **Application of Biosensors**:
	* **Disease Detection**: Biosensors can detect diseases by sensing DNA-DNA or antigen-antibody interactions.
	* **Pollutant Detection**: Biosensors can detect pollutants, such as benzopyrene and parathion, using immunological reactions or reporter genes.
	* **Glucose Detection**: Biosensors can measure glucose levels by detecting the reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase.

**Important Processes:**

1. **Enzyme-Substrate Reaction**: The reaction between an enzyme (e.g., glucose oxidase) and a substrate (e.g., glucose) produces a measurable signal.
2. **Immunological Reactions**: Antibodies can be used to detect specific environmental pollutants by binding to them and triggering a measurable signal.
3. **Reporter Gene**: A reporter gene can detect external pollutants by emitting light when a specific pathway is induced.

**Key Terms:**

1. **Transducer**: A device that converts a biological interaction into a measurable signal.
2. **Amplifier/Detector**: A device that amplifies and detects the signal produced by the transducer.
3. **Immunoassay**: A technique that uses antibodies to detect specific molecules, such as pollutants.
4. **Reporter Gene**: A gene that codes for a measurable signal, such as light, in response to a specific stimulus.
