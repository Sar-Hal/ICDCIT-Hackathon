WEEKLY SCHEDULE
==================================================

To create a weekly schedule for the given tasks and hours, we'll distribute the tasks across 7 working days, ensuring each day has 8-9 working hours. We'll start at 9:00 AM, include a 2-hour lunch break at 1:00 PM, and format the output as a text timetable.

First, calculate the total hours per task per week:
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    "Patient Consultations",
    "Medical Examinations",
    "Surgeries",
    "Follow-up Calls",
    "Prescription Reviews",
    "Health Screenings",
    "Emergency Care",
    "Patient Admissions",
    "Discharge Planning",
    "Medical Research",
    "Staff Meetings",
    "Training Sessions",
    "Administrative Duties",
    "Telemedicine Appointments",
    "Patient Education"
  ],
  "hours": {
    "Patient Consultations": 5,
    "Medical Examinations": 3,
    "Surgeries": 7,
    "Follow-up Calls": 2,
    "Prescription Reviews": 1,
    "Health Screenings": 4,
